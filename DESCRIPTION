Description: BaM (Bayesian Modeling) is a framework aimed at estimating a model using a
    bayesian approach and using it for prediction, with a particular focus
    on uncertainty quantification. This R package is built as an R User Interface (RUI) 
    to the computational BaM engine, which is a FORTRAN executable piloted by text configuration files.
    The RUI defines classes (objects' properties and methods) for the various building blocks of 
    BaM inference (model, data, error models, mcmc, predictions, etc.).
    Its typical usage is as follows:
	(1) specify the model to be estimated; 
    (2) specify the inferrence setting (dataset, parameters, error models, mcmc settings);
	(3) perform Bayesian-MCMC inference;
    (4) read, analyse and use MCMC samples;
	(5) perform prediction experiments.
