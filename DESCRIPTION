Description: The `BaM` (Bayesian Modeling) utility aims at estimating a model using a
    Bayesian approach and using it for prediction, with a particular focus
    on uncertainty quantification. This package is built as an R User Interface
    to the computational `BaM` engine, which is a `FORTRAN` executable piloted by text configuration files.
    The package defines classes (objects' properties and methods) for the various building blocks of 
    `BaM` inference (model, data, error models, MCMC sampling, predictions, etc.).
    Its typical usage is as follows:
	(1) specify the model to be estimated; 
    (2) specify the inference setting (dataset, parameters, error models, MCMC settings);
	(3) perform Bayesian-MCMC inference;
    (4) read, analyse and use MCMC samples;
	(5) perform prediction experiments.
	Technical details are available (in French) in Renard (2017) <https://hal.science/hal-02606929v1>.
